# rustTutorial

This repository was created for my own benefit so that I can better understand the intricacies of how Rust operates.
However, notes are uploaded here so that other may benefit from concepts I investigate further.

I approach Rust coming from a background in C/C++, so I will most likely be comparing the functionalities that work similarly
or highlight their differences.

Completed:
  * enums
  * memory
  * netIP
  * structs
  
Interested/To Do:
  * Pointers
  * Traits
